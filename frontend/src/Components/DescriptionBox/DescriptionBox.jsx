<p> An ecommerce website is a website that allows you to buy and sell tangible goods, digital products, or services online.
E-commerce, put simply, is the practice of buying and selling goods or services using the Internet. It has gained immense popularity as a way of doing business because it's convenient and accessible at the same time. Instead of a physical store where the products to be sold are generally displayed, e-commerce businesses have virtual storefronts where customers can browse and purchase products or services online itself.
